# rock_wine

Rock_wine is a [rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar) quine. As such it should not be confused with a Quine rockstar. Surprisingly enough it seem to work, at least on the [online interpreter](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) and [rocky](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky) (if you can get the right number of trailing spaces from stout). Even more surprisingly it isn't the [first one](https://github.com/davidmilligan/rockstar). It is arguably one of the most underrated rockstar programs of all time (I bet it makes the top 100).

## Methodology

I wrote this program using the famous "change things at random until it works and it also 
rocks" approach. Depending on who you ask this may or may not be the best approach to at least 
one of the following activities: programming, writing rock lyrics. As expected, there are some 
awkward repetitions, but I can assure you that I wrote them just for metric reasons and that 
they sound great when you sing them.

## Innovations

Rock_wine makes an innovative use of comments, the use of which is discouraged by the specs.
This use follows the spirit of this suggestion, not the letter. As every great innovation in 
history it will inevitably bring a lot of controversy and compatibility issues. If you are 
offended by this use and think it is an intolerable abuse of the language grammar, you can 
delete the comments and the corresponding parts of poetic string literals and get a more 
conventional rockstar quine. If this doesn't work, try again. Following this instructions may 
get you stuck into an infinite loop, which should not be confused with a riff.

## Known issues:

The misleading joke probably isn't as funny or appropriate as I think.

## Our next goals (in order of priority):

* Figure out if there should be a blank line at the end of the code.
* Find a funnier name (recursive acronyms aren't mandatory)
* Make a karaoke version
* Optimization, get the code banned/censored,...
* Realize that speaking of myself in plural ("our next goals"), the alarming frequency of the 
world "my" in my lyrics and mentioning a delicate matter like karaoke just to get attention are 
all signs that the rockstar life-style is making me a bit egocentric
* The other grammar checking.
* Try replacing "my" with "your" and "your" with "my" and see if it still rocks (working is 
optional).

If you find a trailing space mismatch or other problems, feel free to submit an issue, it will 
probably make me a bit sad, but I promise I won't yell at you: as you all know, there are only 
two hard problems in rock song writing and I don't remember if it was forgetting stuff or off by one beat errors.
